I'm currently learning and improving on my coding skills as much as i can without overwhelming myself. Adaptability is a key to solving most of the things i have come across, for example: i recently had a coding
  problem that was asking for many things and with such detail yet the output seemed weirdly straightforward and simple but i assumed otherwise and reacted according to what they were misleading me to. You see,
    sometimes coding is similar to peoples thoughts and problems, they might come off as difficult to understand/solve but you dont have to overcomplicate the things that are given to you, i'm not saying don't
      think outside the box. Sometimes thinking *INSIDE THE BOX* is the answer all along. And that question i was talking about was easily solved in 2 minutes by simply writing a cout to a (b-a) operation.

      moral of the story is that sometimes you have to learn to adjust yourself to the situation and not create a delusion of a harder / much more difficult problem at hand.
